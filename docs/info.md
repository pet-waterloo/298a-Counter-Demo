## How it works

The project is designed to simply:

Count a number from 0 -> 2^8 (256) and return it through the output ports.

## How to test

To test the project, you can use a simulation tool or run it on the target hardware. The expected behavior is that the output ports will increment from 0 to 255 in binary representation, with each increment visible on the output.

## External hardware

None. Just have a laptop that runs the python thing.
